Microsoft Teams is one of the most popular communication platforms where modern development teams come together to build world-class products and services. With two of your most important workspaces connected, you'll stay updated on what's happening on GitHub without leaving Microsoft Teams. GitHub integration for Microsoft Teams gives you and your teams full visibility into your GitHub projects right in your Microsoft Teams channels, where you generate ideas, triage issues and collaborate with other teams to move projects forward. Github is designed to work with Microsoft 365 Copilot to search for issues and pull requests."
